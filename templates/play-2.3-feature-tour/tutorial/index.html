    <h2>Welcome to Play 2.3</h2>

    <p>
        This template showcases a few of the new features in Play 2.3.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can navigate this tutorial to see some of the new features using the arrows above, or you can jump
        to any particular feature at any time by clicking the title of the current part of the tutorial, which will
        open a drop down.

    <h2>sbt-web</h2>

    <p>
        The largest new feature for Play 2.3 is the introduction of
        <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-web#sbt-web" target="_blank">sbt-web</a>. In summary sbt-web allows Html,
        CSS and JavaScript functionality to be factored out of Play's core into a family of pure sbt plugins. There are
        two major advantages to you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Play is less opinionated on the Html, CSS and JavaScript; and</li>
        <li>sbt-web can have its own community and thrive in parallel to Play's.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are other advantages including the fact that sbt-web plugins are able to run within the JVM via
        <a href="https://github.com/apigee/trireme#trireme" target="_blank">Trireme</a>, or natively using
        <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Browse to <a href="#code/project/plugins.sbt" class="shortcut">plugins.sbt</a>.  You can see that we have quite
        a number of SBT web plugins installed, from LESS to CoffeeScript to RequireJS to Mocha testing.  The
        configuration you see here is all that is needed to enable these plugins, their default settings will be
        included in any project that is using sbt-web (and this includes any project that is using Play).  This is
        utilising the new sbt auto plugins functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, this is not the complete list of sbt-web plugins that are available, you can see that list
        <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-web#sbt-web" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we said earlier, it is possible to switch between using a completely in JVM JavaScript engine based on
        Trireme, or running natively on Node.  If you browse to <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a>,
        you can see a configuration setting for the engine type commented out.  If you uncomment this, and then restart
        Activator, sbt-web will use Node instead (assuming you have a <code>node</code> command on your <code>PATH</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, tying a particular build to a particular runtime is probably not a good idea, so we recommend that
        rather than putting this configuration in your build file, you add it to your environment via the <code>SBT_OPTS</code>
        environment variable, like so:
    </p>

    <pre><code>export SBT_OPTS="$SBT_OPTS -Dsbt.jse.engineType=Node"</code></pre>

</div>

<div>

    <h2>WebJars</h2>

    <p>
        sbt-web comes with built in support for <a href="http://webjars.org" target="_blank">WebJars</a>.  WebJars allow
        you to manage your client side dependencies, such as jQuery and Bootstrap, as a normal dependency in your build
        tool, with support for transitive dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Browse to <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a>.  In the list of library dependencies you can
        see that we add in both bootstrap and jquery. All of the regular benefits in using sbt to declare dependencies
        are available here e.g. resolving dependencies that may otherwise clash with each other. In addition you can
        leverage any existing infrastructure such as Sonatype and Artifactory repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
        Browse to <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main.scala.html</a>. sbt-web will
        automatically expand the contents of each of the declared WebJars into a folder that is referenced using
        "lib". The next directory on this path is the name of the WebJars artifact e.g.
        <code>"org.webjars" % "bootstrap" % "3.1.1"</code> is referenced starting with <code>"lib/bootstrap"</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        When WebJars are used other parts of sbt-web can perform certain optimizations e.g. the RequireJS Optimzer is
        able to automatically resolve access to WebJar based assets to a CDN; all with no explicit configuration
        being required on your part. More on that later.
    </p>

    <p>
        WebJars can also be used in combination with just about every other sbt-web plugin.  For example, browse
        to <a href="#code/app/assets/stylesheets/main.less" class="shortcut">main.less</a> to see how
        you might integrate the LESS files provided with Bootstrap into your own LESS files.
    </p>
</div>

<div>

    <h2>Source map support</h2>

    <p>
        Many of the sbt-web plugins come with built in source-map support, enabled by default.  If you
        <a href="#run" class="shortcut">run</a> this application, and then visit the index page, you'll notice in your
        browsers developer tools (if it supports source maps) that you can click on references to less files when
        looking at computed styles, and also that you can set break points in CoffeeScript files.
    </p>

</div>

<div>

    <h2>Mocha Testing</h2>

    <p>
        If you open <a href="#code/app/assets/Controller.coffee" class="shortcut">Controller.coffee</a>, you'll
        notice a lot of fragile logic regarding the state of the page, the WebSocket, and so on.  You'll also notice
        that we've implemented this in such a way that all the logic in talking to the DOM, as well as all the logic
        in how to actually connect and talk to the WebSocket have been abstracted away into other services.
    </p>

    <p>
        This practice of separating our client side logic from the DOM and other APIs is a best practice recommended
        by ThoughtWorks in their <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/techniques/698" target="_blank">January 2014 Technology Radar</a>.
        And because we've followed it, we can easily unit test it, using Play's new in built Mocha test support.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you run the tests on the command line (using <code>activator test</code>) you can see a few tests being run.
        These tests are declared in <a href="#code/test/assets/ControllerSpec.coffee" class="shortcut">ControllerSpec.coffee</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, all JavaScript code that compiles to a file named <code>*Spec.js</code> or <code>*Test.js</code>
        in the the <code>test/assets</code> directory will be executed as tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see here we're also using <code>Squire.js</code> to mock RequireJS dependencies.  This setup for using
        RequireJS and Squire on node is done in the
        <a href="#code/test/assets/Setup.coffee" class="shortcut">Setup.coffee</a> file, which is configured to be loaded
        for all test runs in <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a>.
    </p>

</div>


<div>

    <h2>RequireJS</h2>

    <p>
        Play includes much better support for RequireJS than it did before.  To demonstrate, let's start Play in
        production mode.  Stop the currently running app in Activator, and then on the command line, run
        <code>activator start</code>, and then visit <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a>.
    </p>


    <p>
        If you look at the network resources that your application has loaded, first you'll see that with no changes,
        your application is only loading one of your JavaScript files, <code>main.js</code>, and inspecting that file,
        you'll see it incorporates all the other files.  This is expected from RequireJS optimization.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, you may also notice that it is loading jquery from
        <a href="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/webjars/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js" target="_blank">http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/webjars/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js</a>.
        In dev mode, it was loading jquery from the local server, but in production mode it has automatically switched
        to the minified version from a CDN.  This CDN is one that all WebJars are deployed to.  This is the default for
        WebJars, however it is possible to change this behaviour by setting:
    </p>

    <pre><code>RjsKeys.webJarCdn := None</code></pre>

</div>

<div>

    <h2>Improved WebSockets support</h2>

    <p>
        There are three main new features in Play's WebSocket support.  The first is that it is now possible to reject
        a WebSocket with an HTTP response such as Not Found or Forbidden.  The second is that you can now specify a
        different frame formatter for incoming message types to outgoing message types.  And the final feature is that
        there is now a very easy to use method for handling a WebSocket as an actor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open <a href="#code/app/controllers/SumController.scala" class="shortcut">SumController.scala</a> to see a
        WebSocket that demonstrates all three of these.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firstly we are authenticating based on the passed in password, if it's secret, we accept the WebSocket with
        <code>Right</code>, if it's not, we send <code>Left</code> with the failed result.
    </p>

    <p>
        Secondly, you can see we've declared it to handle <code>Sum</code> messages for incoming messages, and
        <code>SumResult</code> messages for outgoing messages.  The frame formatters for these are declared in
        <a href="#code/app/actors/SumActor.scala" class="shortcut">SumActor.scala</a>, they're parsing the messages
        as JSON.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, actually handling the messages is done by an actor, this is done by returning a function that takes
        the <code>ActorRef</code> to send out going messages to, and returns the <code>Props</code> of an actor to
        handle the WebSocket.
    </p>

    <p>
        Have a look at <a href="#code/app/actors/SumActor.scala" class="shortcut">SumActor.scala</a>, you can see
        the actor is very simple.
    </p>
